## Project Overview

Developed an **end-to-end Machine Learning system** to evaluate **Tier 1 and Tier 2 Indian cities** across six pillars:

- **Stability**
- **Healthcare**
- **Culture & Environment**
- **Education**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Weather**

The system produces a **livability score (1â€“10)** along with **pillar-wise insights** for each city.

Key features:

- Integrates **multi-source datasets** for comprehensive analysis.
- Performs **feature engineering** to enhance predictive power.
- Trains and evaluates **predictive models** to generate accurate livability scores.
- Delivers results via an **interactive web dashboard** for intuitive visualization and comparison.
